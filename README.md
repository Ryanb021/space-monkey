## Project Overview 

In this application, it will feature racing space/astronaut monkeys that orbit around the sun. The wins are measured in the best 2 out of 3 rounds with 3 laps in each round. The winning players information will render onto a leaderboard in another window along with the character they used. The players winning history will be stored and will automatically increment on the leaderboard each time they win.

The app will feature a color scheme of blue, purple, green and black. There will be radial gradients on every webpage except where the game will be played in which will feature a starry overlay gradient over a black background.

This app will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the future we hope to implement more features using reactJS for the opening page interface and graphQL to visually enhance the leaderboard. As well as two-player capabilities and audio functions to assist those who play our game with visual impairments.

### Objective: A fun, yet minimally interactive game featuring monkeys racing through space.

# Preparation #1 

## Cooperation Plan 

### What are the key strengths of the team?

Laurel's strengths:

1. Writing JavaScript
2. Wireframes
3. Big Picture Thinking

Ryan's strengths:

1. Product designing
2. CSS
3. Animations

Kam's strength:

1. Flexbox
2. Presentation
3. Debugging

### How can we use these strengths to execute our project?

We will utilize our strengths to build out the foundations of the website. This is how we will choose who gets task with what. The rest of the project will be built out with smaller problems that we can solve together in a mob coding type of method. With highlighting our strengths, this will also dictate who can be the primary troubleshooter/debugger certain parts of the code.

### Where do we want to develop greater strengths?

As a team, we want to become stronger in calculations/knowing how to manipulate the algorithms of how our code works together.

We also want to get better at asking for help when needed. We discussed setting a 15-minute timer for every problem we're solving and asking for help when it runs out so wwe can utilize our time more productively.

We also want to master the skill of breaking problems down into smaller pieces.

### Our day-to-day workflow

1. Start with code review from the previous day. Challenges/Successes?

2. Assist with bug fixes and blockers.

3. Resolve the issues. There will be no moving forward until the issues are resolved.

4. Outline the tasks for the entire day

5. Create deadlines and break times

6. Decide if pair programming, mob programming, and split programming will be necessary for any of the tasks.

## Conflict Plan

### Conflict Resolution Plan

1. Walk away, take a break
2. Get a hot cup of coffee or drink of water
3. Come back, huddle, and discuss the issue
4. Strive for a resolution and understanding
5. If need be, get some outside help such as a TA or instructor

### If someone is taking over the project too much:

We will address the issue with the team member. If this team member seems to be more advanced and not feeling chellenged from the project, they will be asked to provide guidance to those who are not at their skill level. This will ensure everyone is included.

Last ditch effort will be Nerf gun fights. May the best person win!

### For users not adequately contributing

We will discuss what tasks they can take and if that person is too overwhelmed, have them take over an easier task or take a break and collect themselves before coming back to the code.

### How will the team face challenges while at differing skill levels

Our team will reference documentation, learn from each other, and stay open-minded.

### How and when will the conflict escalate if resolution attempts fail?

We have a zero tolerance rule for escalation. 

## Communication Plan

### Availability??

Laurel: No contact after 8pm
Ryan: No weekends
Kam: Always available

### How will we communicate

Slack, iPhone Messages, Remo (sometimes)

### If we start falling behind?

- Be realistic with ourselves
- Evaluate if we need to take out certain features and expected tasks to meet deadlines
- Is it possible to meet the requirements or can tasks be interchangeable?

### How will everyones voice be heard?

Staying open-minded and not talking over eachother. Being respectful to all ideas and respond with understanding, making sure we esure all ideas are properly accounted for.

## Work Plan

### Identifying ans assigning tasks
We will identify tasks on the white board, assign tasks with skill in mind along with how the task should be completed in a group setting (navigator, driver, researcher).

Extra guidelines will be input into the coding documentation as a TODO list.
